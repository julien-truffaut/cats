/**
 * Fold is designed to allow laziness/short-circuiting in foldLazy.
 *
 * It is a sum type that has three possible subtypes:
 *
 *   - `Return(a)`: stop the fold with a value of `a`.
 *   - `Continue(f)`: continue the fold, suspending the computation `f` for this step.
 *   - `Pass`: continue the fold, with no computation for this step.
 *
 * The meaning of these types can be made more clear with an example
 * of the foldLazy method in action. Here's a method to count how many
 * elements appear in a list before the value 3:
 *
 * {{{
 *     def f(n: Int): Fold[Int] =
 *       if (n == 3) Fold.Return(0) else Fold.Continue(_ + 1)
 *
 *     val count: Lazy[Int] = List(1,2,3,4).foldLazy(Lazy(0))(f)
 * }}}
 *
 * When we call `count.value`, the following occurs:
 *
 *  - `f(1)` produces `res0: Continue(_ + 1)`
 *  - `f(2)` produces `res1: Continue(_ + 1)`
 *  - `f(3)` produces `res2: Return(0)`
 *
 * Now we unwind back through the continue instances:
 *
 *  - `res2` returns `0`
 *  - `res1(0)` returns `1`
 *  - `res0(1)` returns `2`
 *
 * And so the result is 2.
 *
 * This code searches an infinite stream for 77:
 *
 * {{{
 *    val found: Lazy[Boolean] =
 *      Stream.from(0).foldLazy(Lazy(false)) { n =>
 *        if (n == 77) Fold.Return(true) else Fold.Pass
 *      }
 * }}}
 *
 * Here's another example that sums the list until it reaches a
 * negative number:
 *
 * {{{
 *    val sum: Lazy[Double] =
 *      numbers.foldLazy(Lazy(0.0)) { n =>
 *        if (n < 0) Fold.Return(0.0) else Fold.Continue(n + _)
 *      }
 * }}}
 *
 * This strange example counts an infinite stream. Since the result is
 * lazy, it will only hang the program once `count.value` is called:
 *
 * {{{
 *    val count: Lazy[Long] =
 *      Stream.from(0).foldLazy(Lazy(0L)) { _ =>
 *        Fold.Continue(_ + 1L)
 *      }
 * }}}
 *
 * You can even implement foldLeft in terms of foldLazy (!):
 *
 * {{{
 *    def foldl[A, B](as: List[A], b: B)(f: (B, A) => B): B =
 *      as.foldLazy(Lazy((b: B) => b)) { a =>
 *        Fold.Continue(g => (b: B) => g(f(b, a)))
 *      }.value(b)
 * }}}
 *
 * (In practice you would not want to use the `foldl` because it is
 * not stack-safe.)
